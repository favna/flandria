      <h2>What is Flandria?</h2>
      <p>
        Flandria is a project that started late 2018 with the goal to make a good
        Florensia database website. It was then first released on the first of January 2019.
        <br />
        Even today, it is still in development and maintained on a regular basis to reflect
        the newest patches.
        <br />
        The development of the original project by
        {' '}
        <a href="https://github.com/HealYouDown/flandria">Jeremy</a>
        {' '}
        was stopped on 01.01.2022.
        This website is is a fork of the original project, which is now hosted by
        {' '}
        <a href="https://www.giikugames.com">Giiku Games</a>
        {' '}
        and presents a continued effort by the community to
        keep development going.

      <h2>How does Flandria work?</h2>
      <p>
        Obviously, adding all information manually would require months, keeping them up to
        date even more.
        <br />
        Therefore, Flandria takes all its data (except drops) from the game client. This is
        done fully automatically.
        <br />
        <blockquote>
          Credits go to
          {' '}
          <a href="https://github.com/Flauschbaellchen">Noxx</a>
          , which scripts were available on Github and allowed me to
          implement those algorithms without having to figure everything out
          from scratch.

        .
      </p>
